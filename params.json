It has 3 main goals:\r\n\r\n1. Be as simple to use, and as easy to install as possible.\r\n2. Be driver oriented and abstract the GCode away, allowing users to easily create drivers for their own machine.\r\n3. Support as much of the GCode specification as possible.\r\n\r\nReplicatorG was originally abandoned at version 0040 in 2012, since Makerbot had better things to do (cough, cough).\r\nLiam Marshall ([@archimedespi](https://github.com/archimedespi)) created this fork with the intention of modernizing and continuing development.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\nReplicatorG is an open source project, owned by nobody and supported by many.\r\n\r\nThe project is descended from the wonderful Arduino host software (http://www.arduino.cc)\r\nArduino is descended from the also wonderful Processing environment (http://www.processing.org)\r\n\r\nReplicatorG was forked from Arduino in August 2008 by Zach Smith.\r\nAdam Mayer took over maintenance of ReplicatorG in 2009.\r\nReplicatorG was forked from Makerbot in August 2015 by Liam Marshall.\r\n\r\nSee [changelog.txt](https://github.com/replicatorg/ReplicatorG/blob/master/changelog.txt) for a list of changes in each version.\r\n\r\nPeople who have worked on ReplicatorG include:\r\n\r\n- Zach 'Hoeken' Smith (http://www.zachhoeken.com)\r\n- Marius Kintel (http://reprap.soup.io)\r\n- Adam Mayer (http://makerbot.com)\r\n- Far McKon (http://makerbot.com)\r\n\r\nA full list of contributers is in contributers.txt\r\n","google":"UA-66463623-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
